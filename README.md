spmvaccsim
==========

A Qt + SystemC + DRAMSim2 simulator for exploring the SpMV hardware accelerator design space.

The focus is on exploring how different microarchitectural parameters and DRAM data layouts affect the sustainable DRAM bandwidth (and thus performance, since SpMV is very memory-bound).
